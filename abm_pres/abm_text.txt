What is an activity based model? 
* Travel demand model that similulates individual and household transportation decisions  

* Similar to 4 step model:
**generates activities, identifies destinations for activities, determines mode of travel, and assigns routes on our network

* considers personal and household attributes to represent decisions resulting in:
	the types of activities they participate in
	the member(s) of the household participating in an activity
	where to participate in the activity
	how activities are scheduled/prioritized 
	the time available to participate in those activies 
	the mode of travel reach each activity

* allows for behaviorally realistic representation of travel compared to the 4-step model


Why use an activity based model? 

*Behavioral advantages
* Each Traveler’s Personal Attributes Inform Unique Travel Choices, making the model more sensitive to planning strategies and policies.
	*how an individual budgets time for activies and travel throughout the day 
	*carpooling, transit access, tolling etc

*Each Traveler Can Be Identified Throughout Similuation
	*works at the disaggregate person level rather than the aggregate zonal-level
	*the model can be used to analyze the travel patterns of a wide range of socioeconomic groups
	* creating detailed metrics on how travel benefits or disbenefits impact differenct populations, which
	can be used to support inclusive growth. 
	Example segmenting distance metrics by socioeconomic groups - Investment
	How far are people traveling to get to work, school, maintaince activities
	*average trip distance to activities ecd vs population

*Evaluteing Travel Patterns
*Travel Is Organized Into Tours and Trips
	Travel for each individual represented in tour, a chain of trips, to generate daily activity pattern
	portrays how trips are organized and the modal decisions made by the person during a trip
	activity purpose, and mode segmenation
	
	example of activity patterns ecd vs non ecd
	mode of choice characteristics for activies
